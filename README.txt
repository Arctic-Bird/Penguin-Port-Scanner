PenguinPortScanner.py for Linux requires SUDO PRIVILEGES!! This does not apply to the Windows version
Basic TCP and UDP port scanner, simply provide a valid IPv4 address, provide a range of ports to scan, and then select either TCP or UDP!

**Known issue: PenguinPortScanner.py may not work on the Linux command line. Until this is fixed use PyCharm Community with sudo privileges to run the program.
